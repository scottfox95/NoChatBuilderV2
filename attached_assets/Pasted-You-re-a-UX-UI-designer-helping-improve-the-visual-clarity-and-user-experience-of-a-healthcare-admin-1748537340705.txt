You’re a UX/UI designer helping improve the visual clarity and user experience of a healthcare admin dashboard. Below is a screenshot of the current interface for doctors managing their Care Aids (AI-powered assistants). The design is functional but lacks visual cleanliness, hierarchy, and polish. Please provide a redesign plan with the following goals in mind:

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	Improve visual hierarchy and spacing
	•	Simplify layout and reduce visual noise
	•	Make it easier to scan and navigate Care Aids
	•	Create a cleaner, more modern UI consistent with healthcare tech
	•	Emphasize the most important elements (e.g., Care Aid name, usage stats, view button)

⸻

📋 Redesign Instructions
	1.	Layout Simplification
	•	Use a grid layout with consistent spacing (e.g., 24px gutter between cards).
	•	Reduce the card size or padding to improve information density without feeling cluttered.
	•	Align content consistently—icons, text, and buttons should snap to a common baseline.
	2.	Card Design Enhancements
	•	Add clearer card headers (larger font for Care Aid name, subtitle below in smaller text).
	•	Move action icons (share, copy, edit, delete) into a “More Options” (⋮) dropdown to reduce clutter.
	•	Use subtle hover effects (e.g., light elevation or shadow) for interactivity feedback.
	3.	Typography & Spacing
	•	Increase font size for Care Aid names to establish hierarchy.
	•	Use font weight and color to visually separate title, subtitle, and metadata (views, model).
	•	Add more vertical spacing between lines of text within a card.
	4.	Color & Visual Contrast
	•	Use white cards on a soft gray or muted blue background to reduce visual monotony.
	•	Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability (e.g., black on light backgrounds, or dark gray for metadata).
	•	Highlight the active model with a badge-style icon (e.g., “GPT-4”, “Turbo”).
	5.	Buttons
	•	Use a primary button style (e.g., filled button with brand color) for “View Care Aid”.
	•	Remove the “external link” icon unless it actually opens in a new tab.
	6.	Top Bar & Header
	•	Increase vertical space in the top bar.
	•	Separate “My Care Aids” and “Create New” more clearly, maybe by moving “Create New” to a sticky top-right position or floating action button.
	7.	Left Sidebar
	•	Use subtle icon styling (outline or duotone) to reduce visual weight.
	•	Highlight the active menu item more distinctly with background shading or a left border indicator.
	8.	Data Display Improvements
	•	Replace raw “views” count with better indicators (e.g., eye icon + “94 views” in smaller font, perhaps a trend arrow or sparkline).
	•	Consider adding a last updated timestamp or usage trend line.
	9.	Responsiveness
	•	Ensure that on smaller screens, cards collapse into a vertical layout with adjusted spacing and font size.

✅ Deliverables
	•	Clean UI wireframe suggestions or updated visual mockups
	•	Optional: dark mode variant with appropriate contrast ratios
